## Spatial_transmission

This is the basic code with a spatial connectivity matrix among the regions. The contact matrix $`C_{[n,n]}=[c_{ij}]`$ denotes the fraction of people who are moving from node `j` to node `i`. Here, nodes are the regions and edges are the connection between `i`th and `j`th region. Here, `n` is the number of regions.

agg_mobility_effect.R and agg_sim_outbreak is the code. Data required for these codes are the planning_areas.csv and C_weekdays.Rdata
